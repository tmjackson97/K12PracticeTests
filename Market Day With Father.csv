Adapted from The Dutch Twins: “Market Day With Father”,"One afternoon Kit and Kat were playing around the kitchen doorstep while their Mother
sat on a bench by the door peeling some onions for supper. It was not yet suppertime,
but Mother Vedder was always ahead of the clock with the work.

Kit and Kat had a pan of water and were teaching their ducklings to swim. They each
had one little duckling of their very own. The ducklings squawked when Kit lifted them
over the edge of the pan and into the water.

“Don’t do that, Kit,” said Kat. “The ducklings don’t like it. You didn’t like it when you fell
into the water, did you?”

“But I’m not a duck,” said Kit.

“Well, anyway, they’re tired and want to go to their mother,” said Kat. “Let’s do
something else! I’ll tell you what! Let’s go out to the garden and help Father get the
boat loaded for market.”

“All right,” said Kit. “May we, Mother?”

“Yes,” said Mother Vedder; “and you may ask Father if he will take you to market with
him tomorrow if it’s fair. Tell him I said you could ask.”

“Oh, goody, goody!” said Kit and Kat, both at once; and they ran as fast as their wooden
shoes would take them out into the garden.

They found their father cutting cabbages and gathering them into piles. He was stopping
to rest for a moment when they reached him.

“O Father!” said Kit and Kat both together. “May we go on the boat to market with you
tomorrow morning? Mother said we might ask!”

“We’ll help you load the boat,” said Kit.

“Yes,” said Kat, “I can carry a cabbage.”

“I can carry two,” said Kit. “We’ll both be good,” said Kat.

“Very well,” said Father, at last. “We’ll see how you work! And tomorrow morning, if the
weather is good, I’ll see! But you must go to bed early tonight, because you’ll have to
get up very early in the morning, if you go with me! Now you each take a cabbage and
run along.”

Father Vedder went back to his work.

Kit and Kat ran to the cabbage pile. Kat took one, and Kit took two—just to show that he
could.

“When Father says ‘I’ll see,’ he always means ‘yes,’ ” Kat said to Kit.

Perhaps it seems strange to you that they should go to market in a boat, but it didn’t
seem strange at all to the twins.

You see, in Holland there are a great many canals. They cross the fields like roadways of
water, and that is what they really are. Little canals open into big ones, and big ones go
clear to the sea.

It is very easy for farmers to load their vegetables for market right on a boat. They can
pull the boat out into the big canal, and then away they go to sell their produce in the
town.

The canals flow through the towns, too, and make water streets, where boats go up and
down as carriages go here.

The twins and their father worked like beavers, washing the vegetables and packing
them in baskets, until their good old boat was filled with cabbages and onions and beets
and carrots and all sorts of good things to eat.

By that time it was nearly dark, and they were all three very hungry; so they went
home.

They found that Mother Vedder had made soup for supper. The twins loved soup. They
each ate three bowls of it, and then their mother put them to bed.",q1,What must happen for the twins to be able to go to the market?,"The weather must be nice, they must work hard, and they need to go to bed
