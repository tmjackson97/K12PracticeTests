        "One afternoon Kit and Kat were playing around the kitchen doorstep while their Mother sat on a bench by the door peeling some onions for supper. It was not yet suppertime, but Mother Vedder was always ahead of the clock with the work.",
        "Kit and Kat had a pan of water and were teaching their ducklings to swim. They each had one little duckling of their very own. The ducklings squawked when Kit lifted them over the edge of the pan and into the water.",
        "“Don’t do that, Kit,” said Kat. “The ducklings don’t like it. You didn’t like it when you fell into the water, did you?” “But I’m not a duck,” said Kit.",
        "“Let’s go out to the garden and help Father get the boat loaded for market.” “All right,” said Kit. “May we, Mother?” “Yes,” said Mother Vedder; “and you may ask Father if he will take you to market with him tomorrow if it’s fair. Tell him I said you could ask.”",
        "“Oh, goody, goody!” said Kit and Kat, and they ran as fast as their wooden shoes would take them out into the garden.",
        "They found their father cutting cabbages and gathering them into piles. “May we go on the boat to market with you tomorrow morning? Mother said we might ask!”",
        "“We’ll help you load the boat,” said Kit. “I can carry two,” said Kit. “We’ll both be good,” said Kat.",
        "“Very well,” said Father. “We’ll see how you work! And tomorrow morning, if the weather is good, I’ll see! But you must go to bed early tonight.”",
        "Kit and Kat ran to the cabbage pile. Kat took one, and Kit took two—just to show that he could. “When Father says ‘I’ll see,’ he always means ‘yes,’” Kat said.",
        "In Holland, there are a great many canals. They cross the fields like roadways of water. It is very easy for farmers to load their vegetables for market right on a boat.",
        "The twins and their father worked like beavers, washing the vegetables and packing them in baskets, until their good old boat was filled.",
        "Mother Vedder had made soup for supper. The twins loved soup. They each ate three bowls of it, and then their mother put them to bed."
